Bloc Jams is a Spotify clone that can organize and play music, and was the first project I did at Bloc. The main goal was to learn how to build web pages that perform tasks with Javascript.

Bloc Jams exists as a training exercise for new students to learn HTML/CSS and Javascript. My job was to complete a series of tasks that gradually built web pages, under the supervision of my mentor Kevin Lee. As a student my main goal was to learn how to write good code a chunk at a time.

 The main problem with Bloc Jams when I was "hired" was that I hadn't built it yet. This project consisted of many checkpoints, miniature problems that needed solving. Each checkpoint required me to learn something new and properly utilize it to find a solution. Initial checkpoints taught HTML elements and CSS instructions, and later ones required writing one or more Javascript functions. The ultimate goal was to have a few fully functioning webpages, including one that could store and play music. Checkpoint by checkpoint, Bloc Jams came together.

 While building Bloc Jams most problems were split into nice small chunks by the checkpoints. The solutions to these small problems were generally Javascript functions. Usually a lesson would teach a new idea or bit of code, and my job was to learn that and utilize it effectively when coding.

 As far as results go, my mentor Kevin checked my solutions and made sure everything worked as I went along. The final results are three web pages with everything working properly.

 This project was definitely different from the other ones I will be undertaking soon. The main goal was really to learn important coding concepts and gain a better understanding of how web pages work and how to build them under the guidance of a mentor. In this sense, Bloc Jams was a huge success. Every problem encountered lead to being stuck, which lead to another lesson, and each lesson led to the solution. Learning that problem solving process was as important as the lessons themselves. To me the most important takeaway from Bloc Jams is not the web pages I built, but the confidence to go and build more.
